# Love & Tolerance: Villager Skin Pack

This add-on features skins from the community made for [MineLittlePony], in this pack the skins were moved to work with a new feature in their 4.7.3+ releases.

To use the skins in-game, simply name-tag a villager pony with the name of the pony skins you want them to have, here is a few examples:
  
 - pinkie_pie.png -> Pinkie Pie
 - fluttershy_gala_dress.png -> Fluttershy Gala Dress

Each of these skins have a zompony version that will be used when they become zombie pony villagers.
